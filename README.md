# Solar Powered Smart Irrigation System
IoT based Mini Project (Undergrad) <br>
## Abstract <br>
In the field of agriculture, use of proper methods of irrigation is important 
because the main reason is the lack of rains; scarcity of land reservoir water. The 
continuous extraction of water from earth is reducing the water level due to which a lot 
of land is coming slowly in the zones of un-irrigated land. Another very important 
reason for this is due to unplanned use of water due to which a significant amount of 
water goes waste. For this purpose; we use this automatic plant irrigation system. The 
system derives power from solar energy through photovoltaic cells. Hence, dependency 
on erratic commercial power is not required. In this project we use solar energy which is 
used to operate the irrigation pump. Two stiff copper wires are inserted in the soil to 
sense whether the soil is wet or dry. The Arduino board is used to control the whole 
system by monitoring the sensors and when sensors sense the dry condition of soil, then 
the Arduino board will send a message to the mobile application. The user should send 
a message “ON” to Arduino to switch on the motor, then the Arduino board will send a 
command to relay which is used to switch on the motor and it will switch off the motor 
when the soil is in wet condition. The Arduino board does the above job as it receives 
the signal from the sensors through the output of the comparator, and these signals 
operate under the control of software which is stored in the ROM of the Arduino.
